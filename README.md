# Happy Hacktoberfest 😊    
### fork 👉🏻 add changes 👉🏻 create pull request

[What is Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) 

### Looking for free tee but feel like cheating about not actually contributing 😕 ?

Instead of ~~just adding your name to README~~ lets share a little story about why you love coding, languages you love, languages you hate, current project that you are working on and *if you would like to connect with/help people with same interest.*    


**_You in?_ 🤔**

#### Example:  _(add yours in myStory folder)_    
 - they call me :    
 - love to code because :    
 - languages i speak better than my mothertongue :    
 - languages i wanna nuke :    
 - my swagger website :    
 - whats left of my social life : [github](https://github.com/) [twitter](https://twitter.com/) [whatever](https://x.y/)    
 - can help you get your shit together or maybe you could help me get mine : yes and yes

### create pull requests after making changes (in myStory)    
#### please _STAR_ so others can share their story too 🤗
